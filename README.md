# Insight

I am a certified degen and wanted to create an app so I could track all my losses :chart_with_downwards_trend:.
In addition, I could not find a free API that included both current NBA game scores and betting odds so I synchronized data from two APIs to make this app free to use. 

# Known Bugs

- Profit chart from Chart.JS bugging out when resizing window

# Moving Forward

- Refactor and clean up code
- Make completely mobile friendly, need to fix sidebar
- Add a five minute time limit for users to delete bets. Otherwise, I don't want users to be able to remove bets that they have lost to affect win/loss ratio. 
- Include useful statistics and create a better design for profit section
